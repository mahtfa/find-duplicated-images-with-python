# find-duplicated-images-with-python
This project made to help you for finding duplicated pictures with "PNG" formats
# how to use
Download and copy-paste "detector.py" in your images folder then add a new folder and name it "repeat" then Run the code :D
# Options
* High accuracy mode

this mode asks as first option in program it will look 3 diffrent pieces of each image in short hand it sucks and have alot of problems and so many bug :/ (don't use it if you like your life)
* Grayout

by choosing this option the program instead of checking RGB make a B&W version and check the with that version (first try normal mode then if you still found repeated pics then turn this on)
* Logs

nothing just to say it will make 2 log files one with every try program did one with the only duplicated pictures
# Detectred Problems
* the process takes forever
* somtimes not detecting the repeated pictures and wrong detecting
* and so much more!

i will fix them when i have enough energy for my rest life ;)

# Terms of use
use this program on your own if you got cancer after using this I will not accept any doubts!
